# AVrecordeR
Audio and video recording using Python

########################
## JRF
## VideoRecorder and AudioRecorder are two classes based on openCV and pyaudio, respectively. 
## By using multithreading these two classes allow to record simultaneously video and audio.
## ffmpeg is used for muxing the two signals
## A timer loop is used to control the frame rate of the video recording. This timer as well as
## the final encoding rate can be adjusted according to camera capabilities
